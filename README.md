# MachineLearning

Work done in Machine Learning in 4th year of Masters passed in Poland.

## Laboratory 1 - bayesian Networks

Bayesian Networks using datasets and making queries.

## Laboratory 2 - Map Navigation

Map Navigation using several algorithms such as Depth First, Breadth First, Best First, A* and Lowest Cost First. In the software we can include the nodes, position and cost, and set the start and finishing node.
